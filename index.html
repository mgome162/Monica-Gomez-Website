        <p class="lead mb-4">To those reading, I am Monica Gomez and I was born in Los Angeles, California. Throughout my years in grade school, I was under the impression that the medical field was my set career path. I went to a medical magnet high school and I loved the idea of patient care as I have been placed in a position to look after my sick family members. However, after many hospital rotations and volunteer jobs, the medical field is not the field that fully excels my skills with people. Nonetheless, this thought did not stop me from becoming certified as an emergency medical responder (EMR) and spending my summer breaks alongside army combat medics at cadet encampments. It was a pretty interesting experience to say the least, but it was at this moment that I realized maybe the medical field is not for me as I could not stomach the needles and blood. Seeing sick people is not something I would like to see on a day to day basis.
e<br><br>

        While I may not necessarily have formal experience in administration, I do have the background. Spent my youth in cadet youth programs that focused on creating leadership laboratories to develop the youth into young leaders that will be ahead of their peers through the acquired leadership skills they develop while in grade school. Started off in the program in 6th grade and followed through all the way into my last year in high school. By the time I started my sophomore year, I was the head of admin which meant I would have a group of staff I would coordinate to put together state events for all 7,000 cadets we had in the program throughout California. During my time as admin, I worked through all barriers of communication and highlighted the importance of transparency. Truly, working in this position for the next two years in high school was the time of my life with ups and downs. Seeing all the events come to life and working through barriers with my staff, I realized how much I love putting things in perspective with my team to see the big picture of our events. It was at this moment I had an epiphany that I belonged in a conference room.<br><br>

        Currently, I am a third year at the University of California, Riverside completing my undergraduate degree in business administration. While at Riverside, a little over a year ago I joined Amazon as a tier 1 associate for their Shipdock Department. Within the first few months there, I received training in other departments and excelled in my productivity there that I took on a role as a learning ambassador. Under this role, I essentially would train the new-hires at every onboarding event we had. However, on days when we were not doing onboarding I would assist management by being their process guide and support in whatever area my department required a set of hands for management. As of recently, I have been newly promoted to the position of process assistant for the Shipdock department. This role works closely with the Amazon managers for my department and my primary focus is making sure there are no visible barriers that prevent our priorities from leaving the warehouse on time.
